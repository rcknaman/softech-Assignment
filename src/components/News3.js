                Microstrategy is now holding approximately 132,500 bitcoin following its most recent purchases. This year, the world’s largest cryptocurrency has emerged as “the institutional-grade digital asset,” said Microstrategy founder Michael Saylor.

            <h5>Microstrategy Acquires More Bitcoin</h5>
            <p>Nasdaq-listed Microstrategy Inc. announced Wednesday that it has purchased more bitcoin for its corporate treasury. Michael Saylor, the company’s founder and executive chairman, tweeted Wednesday:</p>

            <p>

                Microstrategy has increased its bitcoin holdings by ~2,500 <a href='https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC' className='highBlue'>BTC</a>. As of 12/27/22 Microstrategy holds ~132,500 bitcoin acquired for ~$4.03 billion at an average price of ~$30,397 per bitcoin.</p><p>
                In its <a href='https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC' className='highBlue'>filing</a> with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Microstrategy clarified that the 2,500 coins were acquired between Nov. 1 and Dec. 24 by its wholly owned subsidiary Macrostrategy.</p>
                <p>The bitcoin sale in December marked the first time Microstrategy sold its bitcoin since it began <a className='highBlue' href="https://news.bitcoin.com/billion-dollar-public-company-microstrategy-250-million-btc-bitcoin-superior-to-cash/">accumulating</a> the crypto for its corporate treasury in 2020. The company cited tax reasons for selling <a href='https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC' className='highBlue'>BTC</a> at an average price of $17,871 per coin between Nov. 1 and Dec. 21. It then sold about 704 <a href='https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC' className='highBlue'>BTC</a> at $16,776 per coin on Dec. 22. Macrostrategy then bought about 810 more BTC at $16,845 per coin on Dec. 24. At the time of writing, bitcoin is trading at $16,656.80.</p>
                <p>under the federal income tax laws currently in effect, which may generate a tax benefit,” the SEC filing describes.</p>
                <p>Saylor said in an <a href='https://youtu.be/BiTc3tkrcEw?t=2' className='highBlue'>interview</a> last week:</p>
                <p>The most positive thing of the year is the emergence of bitcoin as the institutional grade digital asset and the clarity that … there is one crypto asset that’s a digital commodity … Bitcoin is that commodity.</p>
                <p>The executive noted that both  <a href='https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-chair-gensler-bitcoin-is-a-commodity/' className='highBlue'>the chairman of the SEC</a> and the chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have confirmed that <a href='https://news.bitcoin.com/cftc-chairman-confirms-bitcoin-ether-are-commodities/' className='highBlue'>bitcoin is a commodity.</a></p>
                <p>Saylor previously <a href='https://news.bitcoin.com/microstrategy-ceo-expects-bitcoin-to-go-into-the-millions-despite-crypto-market-sell-off/' className='highBlue'>explained</a> that Microstrategy is investing in <a href='https://markets.bitcoin.com/crypto/BTC' className='highBlue'>BTC</a> “for the long term.” He added: “Our strategy is to buy bitcoin and hold the bitcoin, so there’s no price target … I expect bitcoin is going to go into the millions. So, we’re very patient. We think it’s the future of money.”
